            <h2>Credits equivalence</h2>

            <p>Credits equivalence between schools in France and the USA can be a crucial aspect for students planning to study abroad. In France, the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) is commonly used, where one academic year typically equals 60 ECTS credits. In contrast, the USA uses a credit hour system, where one academic year usually equals around 30 credit hours. To facilitate the transition, many universities have established equivalence agreements, allowing students to transfer credits seamlessly. For instance, 1 ECTS credit is generally considered equivalent to 0.5 to 0.75 US credit hours. Understanding these equivalences can help students plan their studies and ensure they meet the necessary academic requirements in both countries.</p>

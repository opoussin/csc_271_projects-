                <p>Many American students live on campus in dormitories, which offer a great opportunity for socializing and convenience. Dorms are typically shared spaces, with roommates often being randomly assigned, which can take some adjustment. Off-campus housing is another option, especially for graduate students or those who want more independence. Before choosing where to live, consider your budget, proximity to campus, and whether you want a more social or private living situation.</p>
                
                <p>Living arrangements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong> On-campus dorms</strong> provide a community feel but might have strict rules (curfews, guests, etc.).</li>
                    <li> <strong>Off-campus apartments</strong> or shared houses offer more freedom but come with more responsibilities (like bills and groceries).</li>
                    <li> Consider dormitories for your first year to ease into American campus life.</li>
                </ul>
